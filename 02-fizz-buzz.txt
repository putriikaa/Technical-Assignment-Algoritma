2. Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to n

- for multiples of 3 print "Fizz" instead of the number
- for the multiples of 5 print "Buzz" instead of the number
- for numbers which are multiplies of both 3 and 5 print "FizzBuzz"
- for numbers not divisible by, 3, 5, or both, print the number as is

JAWAB :

START 
for(let i=1; i<=20; i++){
	if(i%3 == 0){
		Print ("kelipatan 3");
	}
	else{
		Print (i);
	}
}
END
